List of questions in this branch
1. Given an unsorted array of N elements and an element X. The task is to write a recursive function to check whether the element X is present in the given array or not.
2. Palindrome(string )--recursive solution
3. Print 1 to N without loop 
4. Sum of digits --recursive
5. DigitalRoots of a number. DigitalRoot of a number is the recursive sum of its digits until we get a single digit number.
6. Fibonacci using recursion
7. Josephus Problem
8. No. of digits in a number
9. Power of numbers n^p with recursion and Power using recursion( find a number raised to reverse of itself)
10. PowerSet, subset of characters in a string or subsequences of a string
