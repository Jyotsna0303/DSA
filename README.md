* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
1. Minimun no. of swaps: Given an array of n distinct elements. Find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in strictly increasing order.



TODO:
1. Minimun no. of swaps: current solution is using selection sort with O(n^2). Solve with O(nlogn ) time complexity. HINT: use Graphs
